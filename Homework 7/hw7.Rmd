```{r}

library(tidyr)
library(ConsensusClusterPlus)

set.seed(10)
```

*Find a public available mRNAseq dataset with at least 250 samples and 5000
genes, perform consensus clustering and report your findings.*

# Background

**Dataset:**

GSEA Class2: Canonical Pathways enriched in each subtypes of mRNAseq_cNMF in
SKCM-TM Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (Metastatic)

I would include a url, but the website uses fucking annoying JavaScript popups
to show anything. No hard urls.


# Data acquisition and cleanup

```{bash, eval=F}
# Download the dataset.
./scripts/download.sh
```

The script downloads the data corresponding to 4 clusters, as defined by the
posted analysis. One file corresponds to the significant genes, and the other
corresponds to the fold changes for all the genes.

Now, load the data and filter it to obtain a table of fold-changes for
significant genes.
