1. Consider the knapsack problem:

   A thief robbing a store finds n items. The $i$-th item is worth $v_i$
   dollars and weighs $w_i$ pounds. The thief wants to take as valuable a load
   as possible, but he can carry at most $W$ pounds in his knapsack. Which
   items should he take?
  
   a) When the thief can take fractions of items, prove by contradiction that a
      greedy algorithm gives you the optimal solution. Provide the pseudo code
      for your algorithm.
  
   b) When the thief has to make a binary choice for each item, we've seen that
      the greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution. Instead, a
      dynamic programming approach can solve the problem. Please give a dynamic
      programming solution that runs in $O(nW)$ time, and provide the
      corresponding pseudo code.

2. Breakpoint-based reversal sort on a circular sequence:

   A DNA molecule is not always shaped like a linear segment. Some simple
   organisms (such as bacteria) have a circular DNA molecule as a genome, where
   the molecule has no beginning or end. Gene blocks on a circular genome can
   be visualized as a sequence of integers written along the perimeter of a
   circle. Two circular sequences would be considered equivalent if you could
   rotate one of the circles and get the same sequence written on the other.

   Give an approximation algorithm to sort a circular sequence by reversals
   (i.e., transform it to the identity circular permutation). Evaluate your
   algorithm's performance by measuring the approximation ratio. (Hint: How is
   the number of breakpoints reduced after each step?)

3. Suppose we have n professional wrestlers and we have a given list of r pairs
   of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an $O(n+r)$-time algorithm
   that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as
   part of the 'blue' team and the remainder as part of the 'red' team such
   that each pair of rivalry is between wrestlers from different teams. If it
   is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should produce it.

4. Give an efficient algorithm to count the total number of paths in a directed
   acyclic graph with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges. What is the running time of
   your algorithm in terms of $V$ and $E$? (Hint: You can make use of the
   topological-sort algorithm directly.)
