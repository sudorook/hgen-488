1. *Consider the knapsack problem:*

   *A thief robbing a store finds $n$ items. The $i$-th item is worth $v_i$
   dollars and weighs $w_i$ pounds. The thief wants to take as valuable a load
   as possible, but he can carry at most $W$ pounds in his knapsack. Which
   items should he take?*
  
   a) *When the thief can take fractions of items, prove by contradiction that a
      greedy algorithm gives you the optimal solution. Provide the pseudo code
      for your algorithm.*
 
      **Algorithm:**
      
      1. Compute the ratio of value to weight $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$ for each item
         $i$.

      2. Pull the largest (in terms of the value-weight ratio) item from the
         list.

         A. If the weight of the object is less than the remaining capacity of
            the knapsack, then add the item and subtract its weight from the
            capacity. Repeat this step with the next largest item.

         B. If the weight of the item exceeds the remaining capacity $R$ of the
            knapsack, place an $R$ weight of the item in the knapsack and
            decrease the remaining capacity to 0.

      3. If the knapsack is not full, return to 2. If it is, terminate the
         search and RUN!!!

      **Proof by contradiction:**

      Suppose the greedy algorithm outlined above does not produce the maxmimum
      value of stolen goods. This means that some item or fraction of an item
      in the knapsack can be substituted with another item to increase the
      value of contraband. More formally,

      \begin{align}
        \exists j \textrm{ where } j \notin K \textrm{ st. } \frac{v_j}{w_j} > \frac{v_k}{w_k} \textrm{ for some } k \in K
      \end{align}

      where $K$ is the set of items in the knapsack.

      In the algorithm, the loop invariant for every iteration is each item $k$
      in the knapsack has a greater ratio $\frac{v_k}{w_k}$ than any other item
      that remains to be picked. $\Rightarrow\!\Leftarrow$

      This is a contradiction, because if item $j$ can increase the value of
      the knapsack, then it would have been added to the knapsack before any
      item with lower value-weight ratio.

   b) *When the thief has to make a binary choice for each item, we've seen
      that the greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution.
      Instead, a dynamic programming approach can solve the problem. Please
      give a dynamic programming solution that runs in $O(nW)$ time, and
      provide the corresponding pseudo code.*

      **Algorithm:**

      Let items $i_1, \dots, i_n$ be mapped to weights $w(i_1)$ and values
      $v(i_1)$ and knapsack capacity be $W$. 

      Case 1: If item $i_k$ is in the set of items in the optimal knapsack $K$,
      then the value of the knapsack $V(K,W)$ is equivalent to $V(K - i_k,
      W-w(i_k)) + v(i_k)$.

      Case 2: If item $i_k$ is *not* in the items found in the optimal
      knapsack, then the value $V(K,W)$ is equivalent to $V(K-i_k,W)$.

      These two cases define subproblems that can be used to dynamically
      reconstruct the overall problem.


2. Breakpoint-based reversal sort on a circular sequence:

   A DNA molecule is not always shaped like a linear segment. Some simple
   organisms (such as bacteria) have a circular DNA molecule as a genome, where
   the molecule has no beginning or end. Gene blocks on a circular genome can
   be visualized as a sequence of integers written along the perimeter of a
   circle. Two circular sequences would be considered equivalent if you could
   rotate one of the circles and get the same sequence written on the other.

   Give an approximation algorithm to sort a circular sequence by reversals
   (i.e., transform it to the identity circular permutation). Evaluate your
   algorithm's performance by measuring the approximation ratio. (Hint: How is
   the number of breakpoints reduced after each step?)

3. Suppose we have n professional wrestlers and we have a given list of r pairs
   of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an $O(n+r)$-time algorithm
   that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as
   part of the 'blue' team and the remainder as part of the 'red' team such
   that each pair of rivalry is between wrestlers from different teams. If it
   is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should produce it.

4. Give an efficient algorithm to count the total number of paths in a directed
   acyclic graph with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges. What is the running time of
   your algorithm in terms of $V$ and $E$? (Hint: You can make use of the
   topological-sort algorithm directly.)
